# Research-publications
A comprehensive collection of research publications from the AIsmart-Team, including journal articles, conference proceedings, preprints, and technical reports. 

## Research Areas

Our team's research spans several key areas, including:

*   **Shared Mobility Management:**  Optimization and analysis of ride-hailing, carsharing, EV-taxi, and other shared mobility services. This includes topics such as dynamic pricing, fleet management, demand forecasting, and user behavior modeling.
*   **Transportation and Energy Integration:**  Exploring the synergies between transportation systems and the energy sector, with a focus on electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy integration (e.g., solar photovoltaics), smart grids, and charging infrastructure optimization.
*   **Low-Carbon Transportation Planning:**  Developing strategies and models for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.  This includes research on sustainable transportation policies, mode choice analysis, and the impact of emerging technologies.
*   **Spatiotemporal Data Mining:**  Utilizing large-scale spatiotemporal datasets (e.g., GPS data, mobile phone data, traffic sensor data) to extract insights into travel patterns, congestion, and urban mobility.  This includes developing novel data mining techniques and applying them to real-world transportation problems.
*   **Artificial Intelligence Algorithms:**  Developing and applying cutting-edge AI algorithms (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning) to address challenges in transportation and energy systems.  This includes algorithm design, optimization, and evaluation.
* **Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS):** Research and development of advanced technologies to improve the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of transportation networks. This includes topics such as traffic signal control, incident management, and traveler information systems.
